# Youtube-Downloader
This program was made in Python using Tkinter to create an exe file. I made it for personal use as I don't like spending the time to find a website to download Youtube videos. You enter the link of a video that you would like to download and then select the path of where you would like your video to be. It downloads videos in a mp4 format. I used auto-py-to-exe to turn the Python file into an exe file.
